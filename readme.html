<h1>Final Notes</h1>

	<li>If you have any suggestions, ideas, or comments, or if you (gasp!) found a bug, join us in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/">Support Forums</a>.</li>
	<li>WordPress has a robust plugin <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> that makes extending the code easy. If you are a developer interested in utilizing this, see the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API" title="WordPress plugin API">plugin documentation in the Codex</a>. You shouldn&#8217;t modify any of the core code.</li>
</ul>

If you enjoy WordPress please consider telling a friend, setting it up for someone less knowledgable than yourself, or writing the author of a media article that overlooks us.</p>
